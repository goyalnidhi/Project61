                My hobby is gardening that I enjoy tremendously and like from the heart. I feel naturally attached to the world of Nature. Outdoor life is surely better than our indoor life of modern comforts and luxuries. It is only when the weather is extremely hot or cold that I like to stay indoors. But when the weather is fine and pleasant, I rush out to stay in the open atmosphere and natural surroundings. (That is, in fine weather, I desire to stay outdoors).

                Gardening keeps us in two worlds at the same time (simultaneously)—the home and nature, that is, the world of our family and its joys and problems and the world of the trees, bushes, plants, and flowers and their charms. There is quite a big garden in our house. I go there early in the morning and work on the plants for an hour. On holidays, I work in the “green world” in the evening too. My work in the garden changes with the season. I plant new trees in the rainy season. I look after my small plants and protect them against the sun. At the end of the summer, I plant vegetables for the winter. At the end of the winter, I plant vegetables for the summer. I sow seeds of vegetables and flowers at the end of the summer. I do not work much in the autumn.</p>

            <h1>About My First Plant</h1>
            <p> I planted my first plant on 15 June 2020 that was a Black pulse plant. I felt very happy when the first pulse have grown also I learnt by watching it how a seed germinates and changes into a plant and gives fruits. So with this, I got interested in growing plants and started growing more plants.</p>
